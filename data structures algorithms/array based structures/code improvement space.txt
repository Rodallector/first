error checking could handle cases where:
the structure operated on is already full,
the targetKey is not in the structure,
the memory available to perform the action is inadequate,
function overloading is handled

/*
	HOWTO HANDLE FUNCTION OVERLOADING
	
	*create seperate functions similar in name that handle different data
	*check for instances of argument type inside function
	*handle undefined in multiple parameters for functions with same name
	*create eval() function that changes the target field type
	
	if ((typeof targetKey) == number) {
		
	}
	else {
		
	}

if javascript doesnt handle dynamic array resizing, then you must handle
array expandability manually. 
to do this you must modify the insert algorithm
create a new array with all the content of the current array copied to it
trash the old array
this will fail if your resources are exhausted
