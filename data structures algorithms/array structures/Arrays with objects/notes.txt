note that these all use nodes with only one data field, objects can contain many data fields
be careful when dealing with object references

if we wanted to order objects by their data field, and those fields are strings.
we would probably need perfect hashing as a nodeID field and the key as the nodeData

code improvements:
handle searches for data that is not there, and will not be found
