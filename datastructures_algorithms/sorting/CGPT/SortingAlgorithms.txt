The most widely used sorting algorithms are:

Quicksort: Quicksort is a fast, efficient, and widely used sorting algorithm. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach, selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the sub-arrays. Quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and often outperforms other sorting algorithms in practice.

Mergesort: Mergesort is another popular sorting algorithm that also uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It recursively divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together. Mergesort has a stable time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large data sets.

Heapsort: Heapsort is an in-place sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a max-heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to create a sorted array. Heapsort has a time complexity of O(n log n), and it is often used when an in-place sorting algorithm is required.

Insertion Sort: Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that works by iteratively building a sorted portion of the array. It iterates through the unsorted part of the array and inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted portion. Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), but it performs well for small input sizes and partially sorted arrays.

Selection Sort: Selection Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the element in the sorted portion. It continues this process until the entire array is sorted. Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is mainly used for educational purposes due to its simplicity.

Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues this process until the array is sorted. Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is mainly used for small data sets or as an educational tool.

These are some of the most widely used sorting algorithms. The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the size of the input, desired stability, memory constraints, and the specific characteristics of the data being sorted. Different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary based on the context in which they are used.
